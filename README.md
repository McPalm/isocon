# IsoCON
Isocon is a virtual tabletop custom-made for games with turn-based combat where positioning, elevation, and line of sight matters. With a low learning curve and easy to use tools, you can create 3d terrain about as quickly as you could draw on a battlemat, or spend the time to really set the stage with painting and environmental controls.

## This Release
This is the v0.6 beta release, a major update. As such, please feel free to create issues in the queue or contact me (see below).

## Multiplayer
Connections are made via P2P, which means no signups, no services, no costs! However, this comes at the cost of requiring a bit of networking know-how. If you are hosting a table online, you may need to enable port forwarding on port 7777. You'll need to find and share your global IP with your players. If you are hosting on a LAN, you only need to share your local IP address, which should be visible in the connection sidebar. You may also need to disable your VPN if you're using one.

## Custom Tokens
IsoCON does not include any default tokens. Custom tokens can be loaded from any PNG on your device. For ICON, consider the artwork from the PDF, available at the ICON discord (https://discord.com/channels/426286410496999425/871618578489684018/1127608333902291034). IsoCON will handle copying your tokens to other clients automatically. Copied tokens can be found in the data directory under /hashed-tokens. Do not rename hashed-tokens.

## Feedback
